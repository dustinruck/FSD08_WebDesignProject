Initial Meeting:

·       Video on homepage could be a good idea (like fourwinds brewing)
·       How to differentiate the four different trade shows: beer focused trade shows, farmer’s market local business trade show, eco-friendly business trade show, sustainable brewing trade show
·       About, our story pages, 
·       Each group member will make a wireframe for the homepage and we will reconvene to make a final decision on the design



Notes on our wireframes: 

- videos or images (slideshow) at the top 
- I like the calendar widget (sometimes they can we problematic- no) 
- see how we’re making a difference button. 
- “organic local sustainable” 
- discussion: products before trade shows?? 
- can we actually sell? 
- are we looking for sponsors or customers? 
 - this isn’t e-commerce 
- NO calendar widget 
- Socials news feed!! (We like this) 
- search logo 
- blocks of large images to fill up page (our brewery and pub) 
- newsletter in large image 
- blurb abut environmentalism with “see how we’re making a difference” 
- scrap “our mission” from home page, but allude to it. 
- fixed header - snap scroll 
- Where should be have our contact information? - both. 
- logo dips down into video - pops back up as we scroll. 

Notes on our mockups:
-All headings should be in lower case
-We are getting rid of the one green (#41644A)
-Unifying headers and footers 
- Using the wispier logo 
- adding address to our footer 
-background will be off-white
